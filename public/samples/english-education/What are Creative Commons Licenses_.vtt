This video will introduce you to Creative Commons Licenses, which may copyright easier to understand.

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
Let's say you create something.

00:09.000 --> 00:15.000
This thing could be creative, like a picture of your cat, or scholarly, like an essay about cats.

00:16.000 --> 00:22.000
Because you are the creator of this picture or essay, Copyright allows you to decide what people can do with your creation.

00:22.000 --> 00:31.000
When you are the copyright holder, people have to ask you for permission before putting your cat picture into a PowerPoint or adapting your cat essay into a movie.

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
Getting permission can be time consuming and complicated for both the creator and the user.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
This is where Creative Commons can help.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
Creative Commons exists to make permissions explicit and straightforward.

00:46.000 --> 00:56.000
Creative Commons licenses use icons and simple language so that creators can make their intentions clear and users can be certain that their use of a work is legal.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.000
These different licenses help people understand if and how they can use, share, or build on a work.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.000
This icon means that only non-commercial uses are permitted so no one can profit from using your picture.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.000
This icon means that no one can make changes to the original work, such as photoshopping a dog into your cat picture.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.000
This icon means that someone can change your work, but their version must be shared under the same license as yours.

01:25.000 --> 01:33.000
All Creative Commons licenses give credit to the original creator, preserving your reputation as a creative genius while the world engages with your work.

01:34.000 --> 01:41.000
Licenses can be attached to most things, including blog posts, images, artworks, journal articles, and more.

01:42.000 --> 01:49.000
